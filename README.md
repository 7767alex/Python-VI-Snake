# Snake_QLearn_ValueIteration
Used Qlearning and value iteration to train a AI to play a game of snake

project was created by Alex Orozco, Travis Quigg, Girardo, Kammy Nicholas



to use:

import either Qlearning.py files or Valueiteration.py(replace snake.py) to get desired results. 
make main your terminal call and keep all files localized

there is a slight bug in qlearning where it goes out of bounds. ignore it and run the file again.
